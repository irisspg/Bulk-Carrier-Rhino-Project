# Bulk Carrier Ship Design

## Overview
This project, conducted in the **Naval Architecture** course, aims to apply a wide range of engineering principles—including **naval architecture, physics, and mathematics**—to design a **Bulk Carrier**. The objective is to understand the challenges faced by naval engineers in ship design and construction.

## Project Details
- **Initial Data:** Key ship parameters were provided to determine essential dimensions.
- **Weight Estimations:** Calculations included lightweight ship weight, structure, machinery, consumables, and maximum loaded displacement.
- **Iterative Calculations:** Several iterations were performed to achieve realistic values.
- **3D Modeling:** The ship was modeled using **Rhino 3D**.
- **Gross and Net Tonnage:** Estimated values were calculated.
- **General Arrangement:** A layout of the ship’s compartments was developed.
