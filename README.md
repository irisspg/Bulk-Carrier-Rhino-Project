# Bulk Carrier Design Project

## Overview
This project, conducted in the **Naval Architecture** course, focuses on the conceptual design of a **Bulk Carrier**. The goal was to apply knowledge from naval architecture, physics, and mathematics to determine the ship's primary dimensions and understand the challenges faced by naval engineers.

## Project Details
- **Initial Data:** Provided base values used to determine essential ship dimensions.
- **Weight Estimations:** Calculations included the lightweight ship, structure, machinery, consumables, and full load displacement.
- **Iterative Process:** Multiple iterations were performed to refine the values for greater accuracy.
- **3D Modeling:** The final design was modeled using **Rhino 3D**.
- **Gross and Net Tonnage Estimation:** The ship's tonnage values were estimated, and the general arrangement was developed.

## Files
- `Calculations.xlsx` – Spreadsheet containing all calculations for ship dimensions and weights.
- `BulkCarrier_Model.png` – Rendered image of the ship model.
- `General_Arrangement.pdf` – The general arrangement of the vessel.
- `Report.pdf` – Detailed documentation covering methodology, calculations, and conclusions.

## Key Aspects
- **Naval Architecture Principles:** Applied fundamental principles for ship design.
- **Weight Estimation:** Ensured accurate calculations for different ship components.
- **3D Modeling:** Used Rhino 3D to visualize the final design.
- **Tonnage Calculations:** Estimated both gross and net tonnage based on ship parameters.
